.SYNOPSIS 
    Copies a file to an Azure VM.

.DESCRIPTION
    This runbook copies a local file from a runbook host to an Azure virtual machine.
    Connect-AzureVM must be imported and published in order for this runbook to work. The Connect-AzureVM
	runbook sets up the connection to the virtual machine where the local file will be copied to.  

	When using this runbook, be aware that the memory and disk space size of the processes running your
	runbooks is limited. Because of this, we recommened only using runbooks to transfer small files.
	All Automation Integration Module assets in your account are loaded into your processes,
	so be aware that the more Integration Modules you have in your system, the smaller the free space in
	your processes will be. To ensure maximum disk space in your processes, make sure to clean up any local
	files a runbook transfers or creates in the process before the runbook completes.

.PARAMETER AzureConnectionName
    Name of the Azure connection asset that was created in the Automation service.
    This connection asset contains the subscription id and the name of the certificate asset that 
    holds the management certificate for this subscription.
    
.PARAMETER ServiceName
    Name of the cloud service where the VM is located.

.PARAMETER VMName    
    Name of the virtual machine that you want to connect to.  

.PARAMETER VMCredentialName
    Name of a PowerShell credential asset that is stored in the Automation service.
    This credential should have access to the virtual machine.
 
.PARAMETER LocalPath
    The local path to the item to copy to the Azure virtual machine.

.PARAMETER RemotePath
    The remote path on the Azure virtual machine where the item should be copied to.

.EXAMPLE
    Copy-ItemToAzureVM -AzureConnectionName "AzureConnection" -ServiceName "myService" -VMName "myVM" -VMCredentialName "myVMCred" -LocalPath ".\myFile.txt" -RemotePath "C:\Users\username\myFileCopy.txt"
